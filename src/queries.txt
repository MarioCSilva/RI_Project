Effecient!!	Awesome,and quick process. Way better than trekking down to the local Gamestop or Walmart. Highly recommend buying MS points from Amazon.
This game does not work unless you have the perfect system. Not a super fantastic up to date system, mind you, but one that falls within the narrow margins of acceptable hardware. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you don't have the requisite hardware.  I can't return it (thanks Amazon) and UbiSOFT has done nothing to remedy the problem (Thanks UbiSOFT).  Seriously, I just spent 10 bucks for absolutely NOTHING!!! I find this type of business practice shameful.  Ridiculous.
